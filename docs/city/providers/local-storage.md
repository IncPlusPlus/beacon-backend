# Local Storage
To just store user-uploaded files on your local storage, you don't need to configure anything. Items will, by default, be stored in a folder called "upload-dir". You can change the name of the folder or its path by changing the City's application.yml. The default storage configuration is as follows.
```yaml
storage:
  location: upload-dir
```
